## Case : Lectures & Lesroosters

### Problem specification: 
For study period 4 at Science Park, students enrolled in courses. Each course can have 
several of the following study formats each week: lectures, working groups, practicals.
Each of these study formats needs to be scheduled in one of several lecture rooms, which 
have a certain capacity. The task is to make a schedule for the lecture rooms to fit all 
study activities for each course as effectively as possible.
